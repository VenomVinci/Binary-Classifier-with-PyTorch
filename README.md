# Binary Classifier with PyTorch

A simple and configurable binary classifier implemented in PyTorch.  
This project demonstrates a neural network for binary classification using fully connected layers, ReLU activation, dropout, and binary cross-entropy loss.

---

## Features
- Configurable hidden layer size and dropout probability
- Forward pass and training loop with mini-batch SGD
- Prints model summary using `torchinfo`
- Saves trained model (`binary_classifier.pth`)
- Fully commented and GitHub-ready

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- torchinfo (for model summary)
